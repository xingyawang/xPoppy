Otcas.java       The original tcas.java used by the researcher
                   (requires test_tcas.java driver class to work)
saved_tcas.java  A version with both the begin() and main() functions
                 that should work with the original test_tcas driver
                 as well as command line specified arguments operation
tcas.java        The original tcas.java used for creating the fault
                 matrices delivered by the SIR.  This source does
                 not work with the test driver test_tcas since the
                 begin() function has been removed.
array_tcas.java  A version of tcas.java utilizing an integer array
                 instead of the original author's ported implementation
                 of tcas.  This implementation will cause Exception
                 errors with some faulted test inputs (e.g. tests 1460-1462)
                 instead of an erroneous output as manifested by the
                 original C version of tcas.  This version was *not* used
                 to generate fault matrices and is included for completeness
                 only.
